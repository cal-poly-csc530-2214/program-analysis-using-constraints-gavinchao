# program-analysis-using-constraints-gavinchao

Started writing a method to parse through a program to figure out the possible constraints that need to be used to solve the problem. 

I spent a lot of time using the z3-solver on the programs in the paper "Program Analysis using Contraint Solving" by Gulwani et al. but I didn't get them right so I left it out.
